### Hi ThereðŸ˜„



I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and currently I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Cognitive Neuroscience Unit at Deakin University

My research interests include Computational Neuroscience, Computer Vision, and Machine/Deep Learning with applications in Neuroscience. 
Through this interdisciplinary approach, I intend to study the Brain and its connectivity longitudinally.
