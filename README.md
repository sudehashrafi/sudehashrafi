### Hi ThereðŸ˜„



I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (Minor in Software Engineering) from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology. My thesis was about Medical data Analysis and Machine/Deep Learning approaches for the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's-Type Dementia. My research Interest in General includes Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Analytics. but specifically I am motivated to conduct research at the intersection of AI and Medicine, working on the applications of machine/deep learning as well as computer vision in medical image analysis for more accurate understanding, diagnosis, and prognosis of disease is what I am genuinely passionate about.
